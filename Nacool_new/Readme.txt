- Nacoolcalc (with subfunction Nacool) solves for the Na cooling of a given number of rods with heat generation capacity in liquid Na. Specifying inlet temperature, you get outlet temperature as well as the surface temperature of rods. Tcenter osn't accurate; I'm working to fix this.

- Nacooldivisorcalc (with subfunction Nacooldivisor with subfunction Nacool) divides the reactor core into N pieces and solves for the inlet and outlet temperature of these n pieces. given N rods, we solve each system with N/n=m rods. We do this because averaging temperature of rods is not accurate in all cases (sometimes the temperature of the rod calculated using average coolant temperature is lower than the outlet temperature!). Given a high enough n for number of partitions here, we get rid of that problem as well as getting more accurate result.
