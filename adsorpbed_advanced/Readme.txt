- This adsorption bed simplation is more advanced than the last one. It considers, for a mixture of gases, 
(1) Diffusivity of each gas i through the mixture of all (>2) gases
(2) Competitive adsorption coefficients to be considered
(3) A mass transfer convection coefficient model, which substitutes for the boundary layer specification mentioned in the simpler model, that specifies h(mass) vs Re. Thus one can just specify parameters like particle size/bed velocity to get things, instead of relying on the boundary layer.
