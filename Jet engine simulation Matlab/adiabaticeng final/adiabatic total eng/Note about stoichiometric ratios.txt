The minimum stoichiometric ratio required for combustion is 0.32
The maximum ratio permissible is 2.3

- However, I wouldn't see why one would ever use a stoichiometric ratio lower than 1, as the soot formation would quickly destroy the engine turbines. Even a stoichiometric ratio of 1, practically, is pushing this limit.
